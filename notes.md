# My notes

**7/1/24**

Interface: declares methods that multiple classes can share. 

abstract keyword: declares a class, showing that some of its methods are still
needing to have 'implements' keyword called by a subclass.

subclasses: uses keyword 'extends' to add methods/variables to superclass
_constructor:_ uses super() to call the superclass constructor

shallow copy: creates a new reference to the data object

deep copy: creates a completely new data object. DO NOT confuse shallow and deep copying!
syntax: public Object clone() {return new Object(this)}
